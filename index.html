                    <p>I joined Impact Media to take over the existing developers entry and become the sole developer. This served as a great opportunity as I was given the freedom to experiment and try new approaches of which some were adopted in to daily business. I took over development of a bespoke inhouse CMS for clients and released multiple iterations with new features. Worked with the team to create award winning sites based on WordPress and wrote custom innovative plugins, such as Amazon S3 integration, which previously did not exist. Bespoke work included creating a web based warehouse tool to manage stock levels, and handle order picking-lists, regularly processing hundreds orders a week.</p>
                    <p>Whilst at Impact Media I achieved 4 recognised awards (which are available on request) for the creation of their current site (http://www.impactmediadesign.co.uk) a long with client sites.</p>
                    <p>I was given a great opportunity at Impact Media and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. It opened my eyes to the web development community which has pushed me towards achieving my goals.</p>
