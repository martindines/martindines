                    <p>Currently working at GPMD as a Magento / SilverStripe developer I work with a closely knit team who build, support and maintain sites belonging to an impressive client portfolio.</p>
                    <p>I've taken a keen interest in Magento, specifically module development, and aim to complete the Magento Certified Developer qualification in the upcoming months. I have written bespoke modules for clients to meet their business needs such as - advanced bundle pricing management, automatic product and asset imports, and a reward card/points extension. I am a big fan of contributing to existing modules and have implemented features to the popular SEOPack and Locayta module.</p>
                    <p>Whilst at GPMD, working with a team of developers on large projects, I've learnt and actively practice project management methodologies including agile and scrum to sure on time, to spec, deliveries.</p>
                    <p>GPMD and my colleagues are active in the London development community and subsequently I have attended meetups and been fortunate enough to meet some very inspiring people. It's this buzz and energy that drives me as a developer to better my skills, knowledge and career.</p>

                    <p>I joined Impact Media to take over the existing developers entry and become the sole developer. This served as a great opportunity as I was given the freedom to experiment and try new approaches of which some were adopted in to daily business. I took over development of a bespoke inhouse CMS for clients and released multiple iterations with new features. Worked with the team to create award winning sites based on WordPress and wrote custom innovative plugins, such as Amazon S3 integration, which previously did not exist. Bespoke work included creating a web based warehouse tool to manage stock levels, and handle order picking-lists, regularly processing hundreds orders a week.</p>
                    <p>Whilst at Impact Media I achieved 4 recognised awards (which are available on request) for the creation of their current site a long with multi client sites.</p>
                    <p>I was given a great opportunity at Impact Media and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. It opened my eyes to the web development community which has pushed me towards achieving my goals.</p>
